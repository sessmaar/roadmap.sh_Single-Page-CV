          <h2>Mastering Responsive Design with Media Queries</h2>
          <p>
            Responsive design ensures a website looks great across all device
            sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops. The core tool for this
            is the CSS Media Query, which allows you to apply specific styles
            based on screen width, orientation, or resolution. By using relative
            units like percentages and viewport units (vw/vh) alongside media
            queries, you can create fluid, adaptable layouts that offer a
            superior user experience regardless of the device.

          <h2>The Essentials of JavaScript DOM Manipulation</h2>
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that
            represents the page structure so programs can change its content,
            style, and structure. DOM manipulation is how JavaScript interacts
            with the page, allowing dynamic updates like showing a hidden
            element, changing text, or handling user events like button clicks.
            Mastering methods like getElementById and addEventListener is
            crucial for creating interactive web applications.

          <h2>Why Loading Speed is Crucial for User Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Web performance, particularly initial loading speed, directly
            impacts user retention and search engine rankings. Studies show
            users often abandon pages that take more than three seconds to load,
            leading to high bounce rates. To optimize speed, focus on reducing
            image sizes, leveraging browser caching, and minimizing HTTP
            requests through code minification and bundling.
